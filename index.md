<h1> Christopher A. Johnson </h1>
<p> I combine theory and data to investigate how species are responding to climate change and the consequences of species interactions for ecological and evolutionary dynamics. </p>
<p> I am currently a research scientist in the Department of Environmental Sciences at the University of Basel collaborating with [Sabine Rumpf](https://www.eco.duw.unibas.ch/en/), where I am studying how alpine and arctic plant species are shifting their ranges in response to global climate change. </p>
