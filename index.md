  <p>I integrate theory and data to study how species are responding to climate change and what are the consequences of climate change for ecological communities.</p>
  <p>I am a research scientist in the Department of Environmental Sciences at the University of Basel collaborating with <a href="https://www.eco.duw.unibas.ch/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sabine Rumpf</a> where I am studying how alpine and arctic plant species are shifting their geographical ranges in response to climate change.</p>
