I combine theory and data to investigate how species are responding to climate change and the consequences of species interactions for ecological and evolutionary dynamics.

I am currently a research scientist in the Department of Environmental Sciences at the University of Basel collaborating with Sabine Rumpf, where I am studying how alpine and arctic plant species are shifting their ranges in response to global climate change.
