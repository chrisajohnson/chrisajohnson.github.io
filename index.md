  <p>I integrate theory and data to investigate how species are responding to climate change and what are the consequences of rewired species interactions for ecological communities in a changing world.</p>
  <p>I am currently a research scientist in the Department of Environmental Sciences at the University of Basel collaborating with <a href="https://www.eco.duw.unibas.ch/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sabine Rumpf</a> to investigate how alpine and arctic plant species are shifting their geographical ranges under climate change.</p>
