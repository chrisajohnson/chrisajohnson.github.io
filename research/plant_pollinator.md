    <p>Ecological theory predicts that novel species interactions will disproportionately impact community dynamics under climate change. My colleagues at the ETH ZÃ¼rich and I experimentally simulated climate change impacts on an alpine plant community, which rewired plant-pollinator interactions and often favored novel plant competitors (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richman et al. 2020, Global Change Biology</a>), suggesting that reshuffled competition for pollinators may be an unexpected driver of climate change impacts on plant communities.</p>
    <p>How does competition for pollinators influence plant coexistence? Central theories in ecology, such as R<sup>*</sup> Theory and Modern Coexistence Theory, predict species coexistence in consumer-resource interactions; yet, we lack comparable theories for mutualisms, such as plant-pollinator interactions. Some of my theory shows that the Competitive Exclusion Principle also applies to mutualism: plants cannot coexist when most strongly limited by the same pollinators (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson & Bronstein 2019, Ecology</a>). Coexistence requires competitors to partition their mutualists as well as other limiting resources. I then derived a coexistence theory framework (see figure) for studying how mutualism and competition jointly affect coexistence (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson 2021, Ecology</a>). I show that failing to account for mutualisms can lead to erroneous conclusions about coexistence.</p>

    <p>With community ecologist (<a href="https://levine.princeton.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonathan Levine</a>, I tested my theory by conducting a large field experiment, finding that competition for pollinators destabilized and eroded plant coexistence mainly because pollinators favored plants species when they were abundant over their rare competitors (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson et al. 2022, Nature</a>). These effects should grow even stronger if pollinator decline intensifies pollen limitation, so I experimentally simulated pollinator decline and found severe reductions in both floral visitation and per capita seed production that favored some plant competitors over others, suggesting that pollinator decline may reduce plant diversity by reshuffling competition and driving competitive exclusion.</p>
    <p>Given that plants and pollinators are shifting both their ranges and phenologies (biological timing) in response to climate change, how does spatiotemporal environmental variability influence plant-pollinator coexistence? From an evolutionary perspective, theory suggests that spatiotemporal heterogeneity can maintain coevolving mutualisms. I have developed eco-evolutionary theory reconciling how mutualisms can evolve from antagonistic interactions (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson et al. 2021, Nature Communications</a>), and I am currently investigating how spatiotemporal environmental variability affects plant-pollinator coexistence and coevolution in the face of climate change and pollinator decline.</p>
