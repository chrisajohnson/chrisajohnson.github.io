    <p>Ecological theory predicts that novel species interactions will strongly impact community dynamics under climate change. My colleagues at the ETH ZÃ¼rich and I experimentally simulated climate change impacts on an alpine plant community, which rewired plant-pollinator interactions and often favored novel plant competitors (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richman et al. 2020, Global Change Biology</a>), suggesting that reshuffled competition for pollinators may be an unexpected driver of climate change impacts on plant communities.</p>
    <p>How does competition for pollinators influence plant coexistence? Some of my theory shows that the Competitive Exclusion Principle also applies to mutualism: just as species cannot coexist on the same limiting resources, plants cannot coexist when most strongly limited by the same pollinators (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson & Bronstein 2019, Ecology</a>). Other theory provides a framework (see figure) for studying how mutualism and competition jointly affect coexistence (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson 2021, Ecology</a>). I show that failing to account for mutualisms can lead to erroneous conclusions about coexistence.</p>

    <p>With (<a href="https://levine.princeton.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonathan Levine</a>, I tested my theory by conducting a large field experiment, finding that competition for pollinators destabilized and eroded plant coexistence, mainly because pollinators favored plants species when they were abundant over their rare competitors (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson et al. 2022, Nature</a>). These effects should grow even stronger if pollinator decline intensifies pollen limitation, so I experimentally simulated pollinator decline, which reduced plant fitness and reshuffled plant competition, suggesting that pollinator decline could reduce plant diversity by driving competitve exclusion.</p>
    <p>Given that plants and pollinators are shifting both their ranges and phenologies (biological timing) in response to climate change, I am interested in how spatiotemporal environmental variability influences plant-pollinator coexistence. Theory suggests that spatiotemporal heterogeneity can actually maintain coevolving mutualisms. I have developed eco-evolutionary theory reconciling how mutualisms can evolve from antagonistic interactions (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson et al. 2021, Nature Communications</a>), and I am currently investigating how spatiotemporal variability affects plant-pollinator coexistence and coevolution in the face of climate change and pollinator decline.</p>
