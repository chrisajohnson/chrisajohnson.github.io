    <p>Ecological theory predicts that novel species interactions can strongly impact community dynamics under climate change. My colleagues at the ETH Zürich and I experimentally simulated climate change impacts on an alpine plant community, which rewired plant-pollinator interactions and often favored novel plant competitors (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richman et al. 2020, Global Change Biology</a>), suggesting that competition for pollinators may be an unexpected impact of climate change on plant communities.</p>
    <p>How does competition for pollinators affect plant coexistence? Some of my theory shows that the Competitive Exclusion Principle also applies to mutualism: just as species cannot coexist on the same limiting resources, plants cannot coexist when most strongly limited by the same pollinators (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson & Bronstein 2019, Ecology</a>). Other theory provides a framework (figure) for studying how mutualism and competition jointly affect coexistence (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson 2021, Ecology</a>). I show that failing to account for mutualisms can lead to erroneous conclusions about coexistence.</p>

    <p>With <a href="https://levine.princeton.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonathan Levine</a> (ETH Zürich/Princeton), I tested my theory by conducting a large field experiment, finding that competition for pollinators destabilized plant coexistence (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson et al. 2022, Nature</a>). These effects should grow stronger if pollinator decline intensifies pollen limitation, so I experimentally simulated pollinator decline, which reduced plant fitness and reshuffled plant competition, suggesting that pollinator decline could reduce plant diversity by driving competitive exclusion.</p>
    <p>Given that plants and pollinators are shifting both their ranges and phenologies (biological timing) in response to climate change, I am interested in how spatial and temporal variability influences plant-pollinator coexistence and coevolution. I have derived eco-evolutionary theory reconciling how mutualisms can evolve (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson et al. 2021, Nature Communications</a>) and I am currently exploring how plant-pollinator communities respond to climate change and pollinator decline.</p>
