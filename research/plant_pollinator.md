    <p>Ecological theory predicts that novel species interactions will disproportionately impact community dynamics and recent empirical studies demonstrate that plant performance can be strongly reduced by novel competitors in novel climates. My colleagues at the ETH ZÃ¼rich and I found that experimentally-simulated climate change rewired an alpine plant-pollinator community (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richman et al. 2020, Global Change Biology</a>). We expected plants to suffer because they had lost their focal pollinators. Instead, we found that these pollinators were actually favoring novel plant competitors, suggesting that reshuffled competition for pollinators may be an unexpected driver of climate change impacts on plant coexistence.</p>
    <p>How does competition for pollinators influence plant coexistence? Central theories in ecology, such as R<sup>*</sup> theory and Modern Coexistence Theory, predict coexistence in consumer-resource interactions; yet, we lack comparable theories for mutualisms such as plant-pollinator interactions. Some of my theory shows that the Competitive Exclusion Principle also applies to mutualism: plants cannot coexist when they are always most limited by the same pollinators (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson & Bronstein 2019, Ecology</a>). Coexistence requires partitioning of mutualists and other resources. I also derived a coexistence theory framework (see figure) for studying how mutualism and competition affect coexistence (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson 2021, Ecology</a>). I show that failing to account for mutualisms can lead to erroneous conclusions about coexistence.</p>

    <p>With community ecologist (<a href="https://levine.princeton.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonathan Levine</a>, I tested my framework by conducting a large-scale field experiment to study how competition for pollinators affects plant coexistence. I found competition for pollinators destabilized and eroded plant coexistence, mainly because pollinators favored abundant over rare plant species (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson et al. 2022, Nature</a>). These effects should grow even stronger if pollinator decline intensifies pollen limitation. So, I experimentally simulated pollinator decline and found severe reductions in both floral visitation and per capita seed production that favored some plant competitors over others, suggesting that pollinator decline may reduce plant diversity by reshuffling competition and driving competitive exclusion.</p>
    <p>Given that plants and pollinators are shifting both their ranges and phenologies (biological timing) in response to climate change, how does spatiotemporal variability influence plant-pollinator coexistence? From an evolutionary perspective, theory suggests that spatiotemporal variability can maintain coevolving mutualisms. I have developed eco-evolutionary theory reconciling how mutualism can evolve from antagonism (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson et al. 2021, Nature Communications</a>). What remains unclear is how spatiotemporal variability affects plant-pollinator coexistence and coevolution, especially in the face of climate change and pollinator decline.</p>
