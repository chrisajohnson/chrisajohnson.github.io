  <p>Many insects are in decline globally, while invasive insects are on the rise. Predicting climate change impacts on insects requires models that more mechanistically capture insect physiology. I built a mechanistic population model with <a href="https://www.gf.org/fellows/priyanga-amarasekare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Priyanga Amarasekare</a> (UCLA) that accurately predicted complex field dynamics bracketing 25 years of climate change (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson et al. 2016, Functional Ecology</a>). With <a href="https://huckleylab.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren Buckley</a> (UW), I also show that a common approach for quantifying species' thermal responses systematically underestimates climate change impacts on insect fitness (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson et al. 2023, The American Naturalist</a>). We develop a model that considers how multiple fitness components respond to temperature over the insect life cycle.

</p>
  <p>Some of our theory also shows how fecundity evolves under seasonal fluctuations (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amarasekare & Johnson 2017, The American Naturalist</a>). Theory on the evolution of survival is far less resolved. I am modeling how time-delayed population dynamics affect the coevolution of fecundity and survival, and vice versa. I am also working to make global forecasts of pollinator declines, pest outbreaks, and invasive insects.
