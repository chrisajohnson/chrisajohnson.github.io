  <p>Many insects are in decline globally, while invasive insects are on the rise. Predicting climate change impacts on insects requires models that more mechanistically capture insect physiology. I developed a mechanistic population model with <a href="https://www.gf.org/fellows/priyanga-amarasekare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Priyanga Amarasekare</a> (UCLA) that accurately predicted complex field dynamics bracketing 25 years of climate change (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson et al. 2016, Functional Ecology</a>). With <a href="https://huckleylab.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren Buckley</a> (University of Washington), I show that a common approach for quantifying ectotherm thermal responses systematically underestimates climate change impacts on insect fitness (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson et al. 2023, The American Naturalist</a>). We demonstrate that accurately predicting insect responses to climate change requires considering how multiple fitness components respond to temperature over the life cycle.

</p>
  <p>How does climate change influence insect ecology and evolution? Some of our theory shows how fecundity evolves under seasonal temperature fluctuations, explaining why tropical insects have readily invaded temperate climates (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amarasekare & Johnson 2017, The American Naturalist</a>). Theory on the evolution of survival is far less resolved. I am integrating our population models with quantitative genetic models to investigate how time-delayed population dynamics affect coevolution of fecundity and survival, and vice versa. I am also assembling a database of insect thermal responses to inform global forecasts of pollinator declines, pest outbreaks, and invasive insects under climate change.
