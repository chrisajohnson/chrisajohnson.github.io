  <p>Many insects are in decline globally due to climate change as well as other human impacts, while invasive insects are on the rise. Predicting insect ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change requires models that more mechanistically capture temperature effects on insect biology. I developed a mechanistic population model with <a href="https://www.gf.org/fellows/priyanga-amarasekare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Priyanga Amarasekare</a> (UCLA) that accurately predicted complex field dynamics bracketing 25 years of climate change (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson et al. 2016, Functional Ecology</a>). With <a href="https://huckleylab.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren Buckley</a> (University of Washington), I showed that thermal performance curves - a common approach for quantifying species' thermal responses - systematically underestimate climate change impacts on insect fitness (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson et al. 2023, The American Naturalist</a>). By integrating thermal responses into a mechanistic population model, we demonstrate that accurately predicting speciesâ€™ responses to climate change requires considering how multiple fitness components respond to temperature over the insect life cycle.

  <p>How does climate change influence insect ecology and evolution? Some of our theory shows how fecundity evolves under seasonal temperature fluctuations, providing an explanation for why tropical insects have readily invaded temperate climates (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amarasekare & Johnson 2017, The American Naturalist</a>). Theory on the evolution of survival in variable climates is far less resolved. I am integrating our population models with quantitative genetic models to investigate how time-delayed population dynamics affect the coevolution of fecundity and survival, and vice versa. I am also assembling a global database ofinsect thermal responses to inform global forecasts of pollinator declines, pest outbreaks, and invasive insects under climate change.
