  <p>Insects – as ectotherms – are directly affected by climate warming. Many insects are in decline globally due to climate change and other human impacts, while invasive insects are on the rise. Predicting insect ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change requires models that more mechanistically capture temperature effects on insect biology. I quantified temperature effects on insect life history traits to parameterize a mechanistic population model with quantitative ecologist <a href="https://www.gf.org/fellows/priyanga-amarasekare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Priyanga Amarasekare</a> at UCLA. Our model accurately predicted complex field dynamics bracketing 25 years of climate change (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson et al. 2016, Functional Ecology</a>). I also derived a framework for predicting climate change impacts on insect fitness and population dynamics with ecophysiologist <a href="https://huckleylab.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren Buckley</a> at the University of Washington. We show that thermal performance curves - a common approach for quantifying species' thermal responses - systematically underestimate climate change impacts on insect fitness by simplifying survival dynamics (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson et al. 2023, The American Naturalist</a>). By integrating thermal responses into a mechanistic model, we demonstrate that accurately predicting species’ responses to climate change requires considering how multiple fitness components respond to temperature over the insect life cycle.

  <p>How does climate change impact insect ecology and evolution? Some of our theory shows how fecundity evolves under seasonal temperature fluctuations, providing an explanation for why some tropical insects have readily invaded temperate climates (<a href="https://chrisajohnson.github.io/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amarasekare & Johnson 2017, The American Naturalist</a>). Theory on the evolution of survival in variable climates is far less resolved, partially because it involves developmental time delays. I am integrating our DDE population models with quantitative genetic models to investigate how time-delayed population dynamics affect the coevolution of fecundity and survival, and vice versa. To evaluate my theory, I am assembling a global database of hemipteran insect thermal responses. By combining theory and data, I am working towards generating global forecasts of pollinator declines, pest outbreaks, and invasive insects under future climate change.
