  <h1>Climate-driven range shifts in alpine and arctic plants</h1>
</div>

<div class="content-left">
  <p>Mountains can harbor high levels of biodiversity and endemism; however, alpine and arctic regions are also warming faster than the global mean, forcing many plant species to shift their geographical ranges. These range shifts are often slower than the rate of climate change, creating range lags between speciesâ€™ expected and observed ranges. The figure shows an illustrative range shift along an elevational climatic gradient from a historical range (in gray) to an observed range (in light blue) that lag behind the expected range (in yellow) if the species were to fully-track climate change. I want to know: Are range lags growing over time with recent accelerating climate change? Are extinctions accruing faster than colonizations? And which species ranges will expand or contract once lags in extinctions and colonizations are "paid off" under climate change?</p>
  <p>I am studying climate-driven range lags in alpine and arctic plants across Europe over the last six decades of climate change with <a href="https://www.eco.duw.unibas.ch/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sabine Rumpf</a> at the University of Basel. We have assembled a database of ~9,000 vascular plant species from across alpine and arctic regions of Europe, which spans over 120 years and contains ~105 million resurvey data. I am using this database to build species distribution models (SDMs) in order to quantify the temporal dynamics of range lags. This research is revealung how plants have already responded to climate change and provides the groundwork for forecasting future range dynamics.</p>
