title: "Climate-driven range shifts in alpine and arctic plants"

<div class="content-left">
  <p>Mountains can harbor high levels of biodiversity and endemism, but alpine as well as arctic regions are also warming faster than the global mean, forcing many plants to shift their geographical ranges. These range shifts, however, are often slower than the rate of climate change, creating lags between speciesâ€™ expected and observed ranges. What are the dynamics of range shifts under climate change and what are the consequences of range lags for alpine and arctic plant species?</p>
  <p>I am studying climate-driven range lags in alpine and arctic plants across Europe over the last six decades of climate change with <a href="https://www.eco.duw.unibas.ch/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sabine Rumpf</a> at the University of Basel. We have assembled a Europe-wide database of ~9,000 plants, spanning over 120 years and containing ~105 million data. I am using this database to build species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify the dynamics of range shifts under recent climate change. This research is revealing how plants are responding to climate change and lays the groundwork for forecasting future range dynamics.</p>
